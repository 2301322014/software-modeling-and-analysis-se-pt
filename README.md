## Introduction to Software modeling and analysis
<sup>This repository is part of the **Software modeling and analysis course** for part time students of Software Engineering at Plovdiv University.</sup>\
The course is designed to provide an overview of the principles of building a database model according to the program specifications for software projects. Defining a conceptual, logical, and physical model of the data allows verification of program specifications and a better understanding of data flow and management methods from all parties in the project.

Course participants are introduced to the theory and formal processes of data modeling for various purposes.

### POLL

### Competencies
Upon successful completion of this course, participants will:
#### Knowledge:
* Understand the main types of specialized documents used in creating database models.
* Understand how conceptual, logical, and physical data models relate to functional requirements.
#### Skills:
* Identify the constituent elements of the model and their attributes.
* Define the relationships between the elements of the model.
* Define business rules for data integrity and content.
* Achieve data integrity through normalization.
* Design models for various practical purposes.

### Course Structure
The course is structured into several key sections, each focusing on a different aspect of data modeling. The sections are designed to be followed in order.
